# DKyThucTap

DKyThucTap is an internship management platform built with ASP.NET Core 9.

## Requirements
- [.NET SDK 9.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- SQL Server 2019 or later
- [EF Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/cli/dotnet) for migrations
- Node.js & npm (optional, for managing front-end assets)
- An IDE such as Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd network-programming-project/DKyThucTap
   ```
2. **Configure database**
   - Create a SQL Server database.
   - Update the connection string in `appsettings.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "ConnectionStrings": {
         "DKyThucTapContext": "Server=.;Database=DKyThucTap;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"
       }
     }
     ```
   - Import the schema using `full-sql-code.sql` or run EF Core migrations:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef database update
     ```
3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   The site will start on `http://localhost:5000` or `https://localhost:5001`.
4. **Explore**
   - Register a new account and log in.
   - Use multiple browser tabs to test real-time notifications and chat.
   - Visit `/Test/Notification` for notification debugging utilities.

## Notes
- Replace placeholder connection strings and credentials before deploying.
- The `doc_noti.md` file contains exhaustive documentation for the notification system.
- Static files are served from `wwwroot` and can be customized without recompiling.
- Ensure HTTPS is configured in production environments.
- Some features assume seeded data (roles, demo users, etc.); adjust as needed.
